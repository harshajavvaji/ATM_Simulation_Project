# ATM_Simulation_Project

This is a simple ATM simulation project developed in Python that allows users to perform various banking operations through a command-line interface. The project utilizes Python's asynchronous capabilities to handle multiple users concurrently and perform tasks like checking balance, withdrawing money, transferring money, and viewing mini statements.

#**Features**
1.Load cash into the ATM with different denominations (2000, 500, 100).
2.Retrieve customer details including name, account number, and balance.
Perform ATM operations:
3.1 Check account balance.
3.2 Withdraw money (with proper note denomination).
3.3 Transfer money between accounts.
3.4 View ATM balance.
3.5 Get a mini statement of recent transactions.
Utilizes asynchronous programming for concurrent operations.
Data is saved to files: atm_data.txt for ATM balance and customer_data.txt for customer information.
Transactions are recorded in files with a timestamp for future reference.

**Requirements**
-> Python 3.x
